# emoji-prediction
Small machine learning project that trains two neural networks (one FNN and one RNN) to solve the "emoji-prediction" problem from [Coding Lane](https://github.com/Coding-Lane/Emojify-Text).

Note:
The "glove.6B.50d.txt" file is missing, as it is too big. You can download the file [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and put it in the [glove folder](emoji_prediction/resources/glove).
